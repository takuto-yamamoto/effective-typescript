/**
 * Item 62: Don’t Consider Migration Complete Until You Enable noImplicitAny
 *
 * Things to remember
 * - Don’t consider your TypeScript migration done until you adopt noImplicitAny.
 * - Loose type checking can mask real mistakes in type declarations
 *
 * - Fix type errors gradually before enforcing noImplicitAny.
 * - Give your team a chance to get comfortable with TypeScript before adopting stricter checks.
