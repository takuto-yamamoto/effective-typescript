 *
 * Things to remember
 * - Add @ts-check to the top of a JS file to enable type checking
 *
 * - recognize common errors. know how to declare globals and add type declarations for third-party libraries
 *
 * - use JSDoc annotations for type assertions and better type inference

 * - don't spend too much time getting your code perfectly typed with JSDoc
 * - remember that the goal is to convert to .ts
