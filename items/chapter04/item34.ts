/**
 * Item34: Prefer incomplete types to inaccurate types
 *
 * Things to remember
 * - avoid uncanny valley of type safety:
 * - incorrect types are often worse than no types
 *
 * - if you cannot model a type accurately, do not model it inaccurately
 * - Acknowledge tha gaps using any or unknown
 *
 * - pay attention to error messages and autocomplete as you make typings increasingly precise
 * - it's not just about correctness: developer experience matters, too
