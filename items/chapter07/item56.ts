/**
 * Item 56: Don’t Rely on Private to Hide Information
 *
 * Things to remember
 * - The private access modifier is only enforced through the type system.
 * - It has no effect at runtime and can be bypassed with an assertion.
 * - Don’t assume it will keep data hidden.
 *
 * - For more reliable information hiding, use a closure or private field
