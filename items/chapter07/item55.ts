/**
 * Item 55: Understand the DOM hierarchy
 *
 * Things to remember
 * - The DOM has a type hierarchy that you can usually ignore while writing JavaScript.
 * - But these types become more important in TypeScript.
 * - Understanding them will help you write TypeScript for the browser.
 *
 * - Know the differences between Node, Element, HTMLElement, and EventTarget, as well as those between Event and MouseEvent.
 *
 * - Either use a specific enough type for DOM elements and Events in your code or give TypeScript the context to infer it.
